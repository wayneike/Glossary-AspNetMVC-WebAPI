# Glossary-AspNetMVC-WebAPI

Glossary
A client requires a simple glossary system whereby individual terms and a corresponding definition can be persisted into a data store and later retrieved.

The entities are defined as:
Term – a single word or short phrase that is the term
Definition – a paragraph of text that defines the term

Editors in the system must be able to:
 add a new term and definition to the system
 edit an existing term and definition
 remove terms from the system
 view an alphabetically-sorted list of the terms and definitions

Your solution should:
 be written in ASP.NET MVC (any version)
 use a persistent data store (XML, SQL Server Lite, etc.)
 (optional) be implemented as API using ASP.NET WebApi
